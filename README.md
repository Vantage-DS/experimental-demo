# 1. Overview

This repo contains a few experimental pages that demonstrate how to use Altizure Javascript SDK to leverage the power and value of your realistic 3D models on altizure. The demos here also show some advanced usage of Altizure Javascript SDK. Please feel free to leave questions on the [issue page](https://github.com/altizure/experimental-demo/issues).

# 2 Timeline

Timeline is a very intuitive way to visualize the change of a construction site. Here are demos to visualize a time series of 3D models in different styles.

#### 2.1 Grid Timeline [demo link](./timeline.html).
#### 2.2 Slider Timeline [demo link](./timeline-slider.html).

# 3. Sensor data

Nowadays, mobile deivces are integrated with powerful sensors observing positioning, orientation and more inforamtions. In this section, the demos illustrate how to make use of the sensor data to make the 3D models more interactive.

#### 3.1 GPS Tracker (Coming soon)
#### 3.2 Gyro Sensing (Coming soon)
